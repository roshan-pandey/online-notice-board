<h2>Secretary Message</h2><br>

<div class="well" style="color:black">

<blockquote><mark>"Heights by greatmen reached and kept were not<br>
 attained by a sudden flight,<br>
 but they while their companions slept were toiling<br>
 upward in the night."</mark></blockquote>

The meaning of the above stanza is self-evident,<br>
 nothing comes from nothing, and nothing ever could.<br>
 Success and achievements are commensurate with will power,<br>
 hard work, grit, resourcefulness and single-minded approach.<br><br>

The day has come when every student should realize that with Globalization and the<br>
 tumultuous changes we see in the international scenario, the multinational<br> companies and the corporate world have changed their outlook and methods of assessment of the prospective candidates for providing jobs.
 Earlier high percentage marks in examinations with distinctions were the only criteria for top jobs.
 Now the trends have changed and the students are chosen not just for good marks,
 but more than that they are tested for knowledge they have retained with them.
 Hence gathering knowledge, understanding,
 and retaining are more important than studying for exams getting high marks and forgetting thereafter.<br>
<br>
A saying goes like this "Ordinary things done in an extraordinary way make people great".<br><br>

At BNMIT you are not only prepared for gaining knowledge but you are also given an opportunity to equip yourselves with cultural activities,
 sports, nature awareness, adventure activities, social services, etc.
 It has become an additional and important parameter for companies to decide on the right candidate for the top jobs.
 All this is possible at BNMIT which is located in the beautiful Banashankari area and endowed with an excellent infrastructure, 
 coupled with peaceful environment, offering hassle-free study options.
 The natural beauty at BNMIT is captivating, enchanting and magical.
 It is like a feast for the tired eyes, mind, body and soul.
 The meticulously manicured gardens interspersed with fountains that are like a blessing and an experience that is best when it is felt.
 BNM`s vision is to provide an all-round excellence in education along with multiple skill acquisition to all those students who enter its portals.</div>
